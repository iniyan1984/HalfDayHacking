(The calculation of the sampling error itself is an exercise in statistics. Its fun to think of how you could arrive at the sampling error if it was not given to you. One way to do it would be to assume this was a two-choice situation and use binomial sampling error for the non-unknown answers, and further model the error for those who answered 'Unknown'.)\n",
